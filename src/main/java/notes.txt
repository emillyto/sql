Why we need to use JDBC?

-- to commit Java application to Database(it is like a bridge)
-- We can execute SQL queries

Connection!!
-- Used to create connection with Database

What is Statement and why we need to use a Statement?

-- Statement has some methods to execute String SQL queries
-- execute()- will return us boolean
-- executeQuery()- will return us ResultSet
-- executeUpdate()- will return us Integer (number of affected rows)

ResultSEt
-- It is return type of executeQuery method
-- ResultSet has a next() method

PreparedStatement
-- Is used to execute parametrized queries (it is faster and reusable)
